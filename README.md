# Sentiment Analysis

Welcome to the **Sentiment Analysis** repository! In this project, we explore various approaches to sentiment analysis using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Whether you're interested in traditional models or state-of-the-art methods like BERT, this repository provides notebooks and examples to get you started.

## Project Notebooks

1. **Traditional Sentiment Analysis**:
   - Notebook: `sentiment-analysis-nlp.ipynb`
   - Description: Implementing sentiment analysis using classic NLP features and models (e.g., bag-of-words, logistic regression).

2. **BERT-based Sentiment Analysis**:
   - Notebook: `sentiment_analysis_bert.ipynb`
   - Description: Leveraging BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for fine-grained sentiment classification.
